# Hand_on_data_case
This project implements a Movie Recommendation API using Python and Flask. The API provides movie recommendations based on a given movie title. It uses a combination of content-based filtering (via a TF-IDF vectorizer and a K-Nearest Neighbors model) and collaborative filtering (based on user ratings) to suggest similar movies.
